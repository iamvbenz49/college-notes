Euler's method is a basic numerical method used to approximate the solutions of first-order ordinary differential equations (ODEs). It is a straightforward and intuitive approach that involves dividing 
the interval of interest into small steps and approximating the solution at each step using the slope of the ODE.

The method starts with an initial condition that specifies the value of the solution at a given point. Let's consider a first-order ODE in the form:

dy/dx = f(x, y)

The goal is to approximate the solution y(x) at various points within a given interval.

Euler's method works as follows:

    Define the initial condition: Specify the initial point (x0, y0), where y0 is the known value of the solution at x0.

    Choose a step size: Determine the size of the interval between consecutive points. The step size is denoted by h and controls the granularity of the approximation. A smaller 
    step size generally leads to a more accurate approximation.

    Iterate over the desired range: Starting from the initial condition (x0, y0), calculate the next point (x1, y1) using the following steps:

    a. Evaluate the derivative: Compute the value of the derivative dy/dx = f(x, y) at the current point (xi, yi).

    b. Approximate the next value: Multiply the derivative by the step size h and add it to the current y-value to obtain the approximate next value of y. This step is based on 
    the assumption that the derivative remains approximately constant within the step.

    y_(i+1) = yi + h * f(xi, yi)

    c. Update the x-value: Increment the x-value by the step size h to move to the next point.

    x_(i+1) = xi + h

    d. Repeat the process: Repeat steps (a)-(c) for the desired number of iterations or until the desired endpoint is reached.

    Repeat the iterations until the desired endpoint is reached, obtaining a set of (x, y) pairs that approximate the solution of the ODE within the specified interval.

Euler's method provides a simple way to approximate the solution of an ODE by taking small steps along the curve defined by the ODE. However, it is worth noting that Euler's method has 
limitations. It is a first-order method, meaning that the error in the approximation typically increases as the step size increases. Additionally, it may introduce cumulative errors over 
long intervals or when dealing with stiff ODEs (where the solution changes rapidly). Other numerical methods, such as the Runge-Kutta methods, provide higher accuracy and are often
preferred for more accurate and reliable approximations of ODE solutions.
