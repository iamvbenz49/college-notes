The 4th order Runge-Kutta (RK4) method is a numerical method used to approximate solutions to ordinary differential equations (ODEs). 
It is one of the most widely used methods for solving ODEs due to its accuracy and simplicity.

The RK4 method calculates the next value of the solution based on the current value and the derivative at different intermediate points.
The general formula for RK4 is as follows:

```
k1 = h * f(tn, yn)
k2 = h * f(tn + h/2, yn + k1/2)
k3 = h * f(tn + h/2, yn + k2/2)
k4 = h * f(tn + h, yn + k3)

yn+1 = yn + (k1 + 2k2 + 2k3 + k4) / 6
```

Where:
- `h` is the step size (the interval between two consecutive time points).
- `t` represents the independent variable (often time).
- `y` represents the solution at time `t`.
- `f(t, y)` is the derivative of `y` with respect to `t` (the ODE).

The RK4 method calculates four different increments (`k1`, `k2`, `k3`, `k4`) using the derivative function at various intermediate points. 
These increments are then combined to estimate the solution at the next time point `t + h` (`yn+1`).

By repeating this process iteratively, starting from an initial condition `y0` at `t0`, the RK4 method can approximate the solution of the ODE at multiple time points.

It's important to note that while the RK4 method is accurate and widely used, it is a fixed-step method and may not always be suitable for
problems with varying step sizes or stiff differential equations. In such cases, other numerical methods like adaptive-step-size methods or implicit methods may be more appropriate.
